<p>In late 2015, Billie recorded dreamy ballad ‘Ocean Eyes’, a song that had originally been written by Finneas for his then-band The Slightlys. The song was uploaded to Soundcloud and she sent it to her dance teacher, who helped choreograph a routine for a video. The track went viral, landed her a manager and was re-released by Interscope (whose roster includes The 1975, Lana Del Rey and Lady Gaga) a year later in November 2016. To date, it has had 132 million streams on Spotify, and the video a further 55 million on YouTube.</p>
